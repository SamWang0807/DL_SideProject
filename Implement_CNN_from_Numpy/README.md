# Project 01: Numpy Implementation of CNN
## Purpose 
We had done this project on account of becoming more familiar to the backbone theorem of the CNN and back propagation. So we realize those function in terms of numpy, and construct a CNN network to complete the image classification task. We finally achieve 98.5% accuracy in this project.



## Environment
- Model : CNN with FC Layer
- Dataset : Chinese MNIST

## Dataset
![](https://i.imgur.com/7DCN364.png)
We use [Chinese MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/chinese-mnist) in this image classification project. This dataset contains 15000 Chinese numbers handwritten characters images, each representing one character from a set of 15 characters.

## Configuration
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install necessary libraries
```bash
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Final Result
|Methods |Accuracy
|-|-|
|CNN wth FC-Layer|98.53%|
