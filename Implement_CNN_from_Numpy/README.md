# Project 01: Numpy Implementation of CNN
## Purpose 
We had done this project on account of becoming more familiar to the backbone theorem of the CNN and back propagation. So we realize those function in terms of numpy, and construct a CNN network to complete the image classification task. We finally achieve 96% accuracy in this project.

## Dataset

We use Chinese MNIST dataset in this image classification project. This dataset contains 15000 Chinese numbers handwritten characters images, each representing one character from a set of 15 characters.

## Environment
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip)

## Configuration
